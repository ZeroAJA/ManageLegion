ManageLegion aims to provide an easy way of installing mods for Watch Dogs Legion by making the process of merging multiple mods as uncomplicated as possible.

## How does it work?
Mod packages for ManageLegion are zip archives renamed to `*.mlp`.
Each package comes with a mandatory `info.xml` file next to the mod data that contains the mod's description, a list of features, images and more.

*See the Resources folder for more information on how to set up mod packages.*
